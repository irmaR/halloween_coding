These are some programming exercises I gave to my students for Halloween. 
What is scarier than some common programming mistakes? When your variable suddenly changes its value and you 
cannot explain what happened, when a part of your number disappears, when your program behaves weird. 

If you have some more suggestions for some exercises or corrections please send e-mail to:
