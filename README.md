# Halloween inspired scary exercises
These are some programming exercises I gave to my students for Halloween. 
What is scarier than some common programming mistakes? When your variable suddenly changes its value and you 
cannot explain what happened, when a part of your number disappears, when your program behaves weird. 

This is a part of my teaching of Programming Concepts. The examples are written in Java, Python, and C++.

If you have some more suggestions for some (scary) exercises in other, or these languages, or you have some corrections, please send an e-mail to:

Happy Halloween!
