#Haunted Python code 
#In this example our variable b was possessed by some misterious entity and got changed
#without us knowing, by some phenomenon we cannot quite explain ... (for now)

b = a #ok I declare here that b is equal to a, right? Perfectly ok. I just want a copy of a. 

print("My array b is: ", b) #it is indeed equal to a

print("\n let us do some changes now .... \n")

a[1] = 10 #I only changed the second element of a, didn't touch b... at all

print("I changed a's second element from 4 to 10, and now it is: a = ", a) #ok, this I expected of course
